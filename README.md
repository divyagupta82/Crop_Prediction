# Crop_Prediction
🌾 Crop Prediction System
📌 Overview

The Crop Prediction System is a machine learning–based application that recommends the most suitable crop to grow based on environmental and soil conditions. This helps farmers and agricultural planners make data-driven decisions to improve crop yield and reduce risk.

🎯 Objective

To predict the best crop by analyzing factors such as:

Soil nutrients (Nitrogen, Phosphorus, Potassium)

Temperature

Humidity

pH value of soil

Rainfall

🛠️ Technologies Used

Programming Language: Python

Libraries: NumPy, Pandas, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn

Machine Learning Models: Random Forest / Decision Tree / Naive Bayes

IDE: Jupyter Notebook / VS Code

📂 Dataset

The dataset contains historical agricultural data with environmental parameters.

Each row represents conditions under which a particular crop grows best.

Target column: Crop Name
